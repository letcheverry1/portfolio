"Bridging the gap between Physical Operations and Digital Intelligence."

## 📋 About The Project

This portfolio is a Single Page Application (SPA) designed to showcase a hybrid professional profile combining Industrial Engineering rigor with Data Science capabilities.

Unlike traditional developer portfolios, this project integrates concepts of Process Optimization, IoT Monitoring, and CAD Design directly into the web experience. It features real-time data simulation, technical rendering showcases, and a fully responsive "Corporate Tech" UI.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **🏭 Engineering Hub:** Showcase of mechanical designs (Solid Edge/AutoCAD) presented in a technical blueprint interface.
*   **📊 Data Lab (IoT Simulator):** A custom-built `AnomalyDashboard` that simulates real-time sensor data (Vibration/Temperature) to demonstrate predictive maintenance logic using Recharts.
*   **🌍 Internationalization (i18n):** Full support for English and Spanish, including dynamic content switching.
*   **📄 Dynamic Resume System:** Smart PDF generation that delivers the correct CV version (EN/ES) based on the user's selected language.
*   **📱 Mobile-First HUD:** A responsive layout that adapts complex technical dashboards to mobile screens without losing data density.
